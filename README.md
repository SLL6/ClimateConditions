This app helps you figure out what type of clothing you should wear. If it's cold out, then it'll tell you to wear a jacket. If it's hot, then it'll tell you wear a tshirt. This app is most useful when it's ambigious and you're too lazy to go out and check. As in, it's sunny, but very windy. Or cold, but very humid.
